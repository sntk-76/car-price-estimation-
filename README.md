# Used Car Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the selling price of used cars based on various features such as the car's present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, owner count, and age of the car. The aim is to develop a reliable model that can accurately predict the selling price, which can be valuable for both buyers and sellers in the used car market.

## Introduction

Buying or selling a used car can be challenging, as determining the fair market value of a vehicle involves considering multiple factors. This project aims to assist users in estimating the selling price of used cars by leveraging machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data and training a predictive model, we aim to provide a tool that can offer reliable price estimates based on various car attributes.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project contains information about used cars, including their make and model, year of manufacture, selling price, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and owner count. The dataset comprises 301 entries, each with 9 features.

## Data Preprocessing

Before developing the predictive model, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. These steps ensure that the data is suitable for training machine learning models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable (selling price). Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices are used to identify patterns and correlations within the data.

## Model Development

Several machine learning algorithms are considered for building the predictive model. Linear regression is chosen as the primary algorithm due to its simplicity and interpretability. The model is trained on the preprocessed data to learn the relationship between the input features and the target variable.

## Model Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated using various metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-squared score. These metrics provide insights into the model's performance and its ability to accurately predict selling prices.

## Model Improvement

To enhance the model's performance, techniques such as cross-validation and feature engineering are employed. Cross-validation helps assess the model's stability and generalization, while feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve predictive accuracy.

## Additional Features

In addition to the basic features, additional attributes such as squared terms and interactions between variables are considered to capture non-linear relationships and interactions within the data. These features are incorporated into the model to enhance its predictive power.

## Conclusion

The project concludes by presenting the final predictive model and summarizing its performance. Insights gained from the analysis are discussed, along with potential applications and future directions for improvement.

## Future Work

Future work may involve refining the existing model by exploring more sophisticated machine learning algorithms, conducting further feature engineering, or incorporating additional data sources. Additionally, efforts could be made to deploy the model as a user-friendly application or integrate it into existing platforms for real-world use.
